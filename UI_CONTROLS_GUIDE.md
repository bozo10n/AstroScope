# Enhanced UI and Controls System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive UI interaction system with pointer lock management, annotation deletion, and smooth mode switching.

## Key Features

### 1. **UI Mode Toggle (TAB Key)**
- Press **TAB** while in camera control mode to switch to UI mode
- In UI mode:
  - Mouse cursor is free
  - Can click HUD elements (annotations, buttons)
  - Camera movement is disabled
  - Green indicator shows: "🖱️ UI MODE - Press TAB to return to camera control"
- Press **TAB** again to return to camera control

### 2. **Exit Camera Control Button**
- Red **❌ Exit Camera Control** button in top-left corner
- Exits pointer lock without showing browser's ESC menu
- Only visible when in camera control mode (not in UI mode)
- Smooth hover effects

### 3. **Movement Control States**
Camera movement is automatically disabled when:
- In UI mode (TAB toggled)
- Placing an annotation (E key pressed)
- Ensures no accidental movement when interacting with UI

### 4. **Annotation Deletion**
- **🗑️ Delete button** appears on YOUR annotations when hovering
- Click to delete with confirmation dialog
- Only annotation owners can delete their annotations
- Styled in red to indicate destructive action

### 5. **Enhanced Annotation Actions**
Each annotation now shows multiple action buttons on hover:
- **📄 Export** - Export single annotation as PDF
- **🗑️ Delete** - Delete annotation (only for owners)
- Buttons fade in smoothly on hover

## Controls Summary

## User Flow Examples

### Viewing and Teleporting to Annotations:

2. Press **TAB** to enter UI mode
3. Click any annotation in the HUD list
4. You teleport to that location
5. Press **TAB** to return to camera control

4. PDF downloads automatically

### Smooth Exit:

2. Exits pointer lock cleanly without browser ESC menu
3. Returns to instruction screen

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `locked` - Pointer lock active
- `uiMode` - UI interaction mode active
- `isAnnotating` - Currently placing annotation

### Movement Control
Movement is enabled only when:
```javascript
const movementEnabled = !uiMode && !isAnnotating;
```

### Tab Key Handler
```javascript
if (e.key === 'Tab' && locked) {
  e.preventDefault();
  setUiMode(prev => !prev);
}
```

### Annotation Callbacks
- `onAnnotatingChange` - Notifies parent when annotation input opens/closes
- `onRemoveAnnotation` - Handles annotation deletion

## Benefits

1. **No Accidental Movement** - Movement disabled during UI interactions
2. **Clean Exit** - No browser ESC menu interference
3. **Easy Deletion** - Quick access to delete your annotations
4. **Smooth Transitions** - Clear visual feedback for mode changes
5. **Intuitive Controls** - TAB key is familiar for mode switching
6. **Non-Intrusive** - Exit button only shows when needed

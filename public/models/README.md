## Spaceman Character Model

Place your spaceman GLB file here with the name **`spaceman.glb`**

### Requirements:
- File format: `.glb` (GLTF Binary)
- Recommended size: < 5MB for optimal loading
- Model should be facing forward (positive Z-axis)
- Scale: approximately 1-2 units tall

### Where to find spaceman models:
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) - Search for "astronaut" or "spaceman"
- [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com)
- [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com)
- [Poly Pizza](https://poly.pizza)

### Usage:
Once you place `spaceman.glb` in this folder, it will automatically be loaded as the character model for all users in the collaborative 3D scene.

### Fallback:
If no model is found, the system will use a simple geometric placeholder (capsule shape).

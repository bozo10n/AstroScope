# Room Capacity Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic room management with a maximum capacity of 10 users per room. When a room reaches capacity, users are automatically redirected to the next available room.

## Backend Changes (`backend/server.js`)

### 1. Added Room Capacity Constants
```javascript
const MAX_ROOM_CAPACITY = 10; // Maximum users per room
```

### 2. Helper Functions
- `getRoomUserCount(roomId)` - Returns the current number of users in a room
- `findAvailableRoom(baseRoomId)` - Finds the next available room with space

### 3. Room Capacity Check
Modified the `join-room` socket event handler to:
- Check if the requested room is at capacity before allowing join
- Emit a `room-full` event with details if the room is full
- Suggest the next available room number
- Block the join attempt if the room is full

### 4. New API Endpoint
Added `GET /api/room-capacity/:roomId` endpoint that returns:
- Current user count in the room
- Maximum capacity
- Whether the room is full
- Next available room number

Example response:
```json
{
  "roomId": "1",
  "currentUsers": 10,
  "maxCapacity": 10,
  "isFull": true,
  "nextAvailableRoom": "2"
}
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Collaboration Store (`src/hooks/useCollaborationStore.js`)
Added socket listener for `room-full` event that:
- Logs the room capacity information
- Dispatches a custom browser event that the Viewer component can listen to
- Passes along room capacity details

### 2. Viewer Component (`src/Viewer.js`)

#### Room-Full Event Handler
Added a `useEffect` hook that:
- Listens for the `room-full` custom event
- Shows a confirmation dialog to the user
- Automatically updates the room ID and joins the suggested room if accepted

#### UI Improvements
**Before Joining:**
- Added informational text: "ðŸ’¡ Max 10 users per room. If full, you'll be redirected to the next available room."

**After Joining:**
- Shows room capacity: "Room Capacity: X/10 users"
- Color-coded status badge:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green "Available" (0-7 users)
  - ðŸŸ  Orange "Almost Full" (8-9 users)
  - ðŸ”´ Red "FULL" (10 users)

## User Experience Flow

1. **User tries to join a full room:**
   ```
   User â†’ Joins Room 1 (10/10 users)
   ```

2. **Backend detects room is full:**
   ```
   Server â†’ Checks capacity
   Server â†’ Room 1 is full (10/10)
   Server â†’ Finds next available room (Room 2)
   Server â†’ Emits 'room-full' event
   ```

3. **Frontend handles the event:**
   ```
   Browser â†’ Shows alert dialog:
   "Room 1 is full (10/10 users).
    Would you like to join Room 2 instead?"
   ```

4. **User accepts:**
   ```
   User â†’ Clicks "OK"
   Browser â†’ Updates room ID to "2"
   Browser â†’ Automatically joins Room 2
   User â†’ Successfully connected to Room 2
   ```

## Configuration

To change the maximum room capacity, edit the constant in `backend/server.js`:
```javascript
const MAX_ROOM_CAPACITY = 10; // Change this value
```

Then update the UI text in `src/Viewer.js` if needed:
```javascript
ðŸ’¡ Max 10 users per room. // Update this message
{activeUsers.length}/10 users // Update this display
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Normal Join
1. Start the backend server
2. Open the viewer in a browser
3. Join room "1" with less than 10 users
4. âœ… Should join successfully

### Test Scenario 2: Full Room
1. Simulate 10 users in room "1" (or open 10 browser tabs)
2. Try to join room "1" with an 11th user
3. âœ… Should show dialog suggesting room "2"
4. âœ… Accept to automatically join room "2"

### Test Scenario 3: Capacity Display
1. Join a room with multiple users
2. âœ… Check the capacity indicator shows correct count
3. âœ… Badge color changes based on capacity:
   - Green when plenty of space
   - Orange when 8-9 users
   - Red when full (10 users)

## API Testing

Test the room capacity endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/room-capacity/1
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "roomId": "1",
  "currentUsers": 5,
  "maxCapacity": 10,
  "isFull": false,
  "nextAvailableRoom": "1"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents overcrowding** - Ensures rooms don't exceed capacity
2. **Automatic scaling** - Users are seamlessly directed to available rooms
3. **Visual feedback** - Users can see room capacity status at a glance
4. **Configurable** - Easy to change the max capacity in one place
5. **User-friendly** - Clear dialog explains what's happening

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Allow administrators to set different capacities per room
- Add room creation with custom capacity
- Show a list of all rooms with their current capacity
- Implement room reservations
- Add waiting list for full rooms
- Auto-balance users across rooms
